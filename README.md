# Classification-of-Emergency-Severity-Index-ESI-
The Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is a five-level emergency department (ED) triage algorithm that provides clinically relevant stratification of patients into five groups from 1 (most urgent) to 5 (least urgent) on the basis of acuity and resource needs. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) funded initial work on the ESI. In 2019, the Emergency Nurses Association acquired the ESI five-level emergency triage system. Since its acquisition, ENA has focused on improving the triage learning platform to help emergency nurses better understand ESI and better identify patients who should be seen first, while prioritizing the care of patients with less urgent conditions. For more information

We divide the ESI levels into 2 levels. 1 Meaning need care and should stay in the hospital. 0 Meaning the patient doesn't need a high level of care and it is unnecessary to stay at the hospital.

We apply feature extraction and selection techniques and successfully reduce the number of features from 568 to just 24 features.

All the results and development of the models are written in python in the jupyter notebook "ESI Prediction".
